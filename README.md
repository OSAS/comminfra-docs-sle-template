# Service Level Expectations (SLE) template files

The files in this repo are the canonical files needed to document a working relationship between the Red Hat Open Source and Standards team's Community Infrastructure (CommInfra) operations group ... and ... any upstream the OSAS CommInfra team works with.

The purpose of these template files when used in a project are to:

* Define a standard set of templates that can be used to document a service-level relationship.
* Document established expectations following discussions between project members.
* Provide a set of best practice project relationship documents that are tied to a maintained upstream of canonical source material for project SLE content.

## How to use this repo:

_*FIXME - steps are likely very wrong ...*_
# Fork the template repo to a new repo in the form of github.com/osas/comminfra-docs-sle-projectname/.
# Modify the templates to match your project, working with the program manager for the CommInfra team.
# Commit to the git repo and track.
# Somehow maintain a relationship with the templates so you can benefit from additional files and improvements to the template. _*FIXME*_
